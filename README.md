## Pathophysiology

---

- ↑ acid exposure in esophagus, caused by ↑ transient LES relaxations.

***Worsened by*** 

            ↑ intra-abdominal pressure (eg, obesity, pregnancy), 

            ↓ esophagogastric motility, hiatal hernia.

- Rarely caused by ↑ acid production except in ↑ secretory states (eg, Zollinger-Ellison)
- Precipitants: supine position, fatty foods, caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes, **CCB**, pregnancy

- **Q**
    
    A 60-year-old woman is evaluated for a 3-week history of substernal chest pain. The pain is dull, nonradiating, and unrelated to activities.
    
    Sometimes the pain is worse after eating spicy foods and can be occasionally triggered by emotional stress. She has not had shortness of breath or weakness. She is moderately active, walking a mile each day.
    
    She generally eats a “healthy heart” diet but has never had her lipid levels evaluated. She has never smoked cigarettes. There is no family history of heart disease. Other than the current problem, she is well and takes no medications.
    
    On physical examination, blood pressure is 135/75 mm Hg, pulse rate is
    70/min, and respiration rate is 12/min. The remainder of the
    examination is normal.
    An electrocardiogram is normal.
    
    Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
    A - Ambulatory pH testing
    B - Esophageal manometry
    C - Exercise stress test
    D - Upper endoscopy
    
- **A**
    
    Correct Answer: C
    
    Although gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most common cause of noncardiac chest pain, a cardiac evaluation should be considered to rule out cardiac causes before initiating treatment for GERD.

- **Q**
    
    A 55-year-old man is evaluated in follow-up for acid reflux. He has an 8- year history of heartburn, which was previously well controlled with once-daily pantoprazole.
    
     His dosage was increased to twice daily 10 weeks ago because he was having nocturnal heartburn. Despite the increase in medication, he has had minimal improvement in symptoms.
    The patient verified that he is taking the medication 30 minutes before meals. He takes no other medications.
    
    Physical examination is unremarkable.
    Upper endoscopy findings are normal.
    
    Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
    A - Ambulatory pH impedance monitoring
    B - Barium esophagogram
    C - Esophageal manometry
    D - Fundoplication
    
- **A**
    
    Correct Answer: A
    
    Ambulatory pH impedance testing while not taking a proton pump inhibitor is useful in patients who have atypical symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux to determine if reflux is the cause of the symptoms; 
    
    it is also useful in patients who are symptomatic while on a proton pump inhibitor to determine if there is continued acid exposure.

## Diagnosis

---

***Clinical diagnosis based on sx and response to empiric trial of PPI (“PPI test”)***

### EGD: *if*

(1) ∅ response to PPI; ***or if*** 

(2) alarm features: **dysphagia, vomiting, ↓ wt, anemia**

- If dx uncertain & EGD nl → do :
    
      **esoph manometry w/ 24-h pH monitoring** ± impedance, to diagnose :
    
    - “***Nonerosive reflux disease***”:
    
              no erosion, ulceration or Barrett’s; 
    
             ½ abnl pH.
    
        Unpredictable response to PPI. 
    
             Most will not progress to erosive esophagitis or Barrett’s
    
    - “***Reflux hypersensitivity***”: nl acid exposure on pH/impedance **w/ symptom–reflux assoc.**
    - “***Functional heartburn***”: nl acid exposure on pH/impedance **w/o symptom–reflux assoc.**

- **Q**
    
    A 48-year-old man is evaluated for a 4-week history of heartburn that awakens him at night. The symptoms occur about three times per week.
    He has been taking over-the-counter antacids with incomplete relief.
    Food triggers include coffee and spicy foods. He has not had unintentional weight loss or difficulty swallowing.
    Physical examination and laboratory studies are normal.
    
    Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
    A - Ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring
    B - Esophageal manometry
    C - Trial of a proton pump inhibitor
    D - Upper endoscopy
    
- **A**
    
    Correct Answer: C
    
    In a patient without alarm features (dysphagia, unintentional weightloss, hematemesis, or melena), symptom relief with an empiric trial of a proton pump inhibitor confirms the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

- **Q**
    
    A 44-year-old man is evaluated in follow-up for symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Eight weeks ago he was evaluated for heartburn and a sour taste in his mouth and was started on once-daily pantoprazole. 
    
    Despite improvement in his heartburn symptoms, he continues to wake up with an acid taste in the middle of the night. He has not had difficulty swallowing and has no reflux symptoms during the day. He confirms that he takes the medication 30 minutes before a meal.
    Physical examination is unremarkable.
    
    Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
    A - Add metoclopramide
    B - Increase pantoprazole to twice daily
    C - Perform upper endoscopy
    D - Switch to omeprazole
    
- **A**
    
    Correct Answer: B
    
    Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease with no alarm symptoms who have a **partial** response to **once**-daily proton pump inhibitor therapy should have their dose increased to **twice** daily.
    

---

## Treatment

---

### Lifestyle:

avoid precipitants, lose weight, avoid large & late meals, elevate head of bed

### Medical:

PPI achieve relief in 80–90% of Pts; H2 blockers for intermittent sx

### Refractory:

confirm w/ pH testing (**on PPI** to assess need for ↑ Rx, or off PPI to verify dx).

- If acidic or sx correlate w/ reflux episodes:

surgical fundoplication (emerging Rx: LES sphincter augmentation w/ radiofrequency, implantable magnetic or electrical devices)

- If nl pH or no sx correlation: Dx: ” functional heartburn”.

Rx w/ TCA, SSRI or baclofen.

- **Q**
    
    A 64-year-old man with a long history of abdominal pain, heartburn, and dyspepsia has an EGD to evaluate for peptic ulcer disease. No gastric or duodenal ulcers are found, but there are tongues of reddish mucosa extending proximally from the gastroesophageal junction into the esophagus. 
    
    Biopsies of these areas demonstrate columnar metaplasia. 
    
    **All** of the following statements regarding this diagnosis are true ***EXCEPT:***
    
    A. Finding high-grade dysplasia mandates further intervention.
    
    B. High-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy will likely cause regression of the mucosal abnormalities.
    C. The incidence of these lesions has increased in the era of potent acid suppression.
    D. The patient has a high risk of coexisting cancer.
    E. The patient is at significant risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
    
- **A**
    
    The answer is B.

- **Q**
    
    A 65-year-old man is evaluated for a 4-week history of worsening reflux and heartburn.
    
    He has a 10-year history of heartburn that was previously well controlled with omeprazole. Recently he noticed that the medication is less effective, and he is experiencing heartburn in the afternoon.
    
    He has no dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss. He takes no other medications.
    
    On physical examination, vital signs are normal. The remainder of the
    examination, including abdominal examination, is unremarkable.
    
    Upper endoscopy shows a small hiatal hernia and salmon-colored mucosa in the distal esophagus. Pathology results reveal a diagnosis of Barrett esophagus with high-grade dysplasia.
    
    Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
    A - Endoscopic ablation
    B - Esophagectomy
    C - Fundoplication
    D - Repeat upper endoscopy in 1 year
    
- **A**
    
    Correct Answer: A
    
    Treatment to remove Barrett esophagus is recommended for patients with confirmed high-grade dysplasia and can be done with endoscopic therapies that include radiofrequency ablation, photodynamic therapy, or endoscopic mucosal resection

- **Q**
    
    A 70-year-old man is evaluated in follow-up for heartburn of 7 years' duration. He has frequent nocturnal reflux but has not had odynophagia or dysphagia, and his weight has been stable. He was recently started on once-daily omeprazole with good control of his symptoms. 
    
    He has a 30- pack-year history of cigarette smoking and continues to smoke.
    
    On physical examination, vital signs are normal; BMI is 29. The remainder of the physical examination is normal.
    
    He is concerned about his long-term heartburn symptoms and expresses an interest in further evaluation to assess his risk of cancer because of his prolonged symptoms. Based on his risk factors and after discussing with the patient the benefits and harms of screening endoscopy for
    Barrett esophagus, upper endoscopy is performed. An area of salmon-colored mucosa is seen in the esophagus, and biopsies confirm Barrett
    esophagus without dysplasia.
    
    Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
    A - Endoscopic ablation
    B - Esophagectomy
    C - Fundoplication
    D - Repeat upper endoscopy in 3 to 5 years
    
- **A**
    
    Correct Answer: D
    
    In patients with Barrett esophagus and no dysplasia, surveillance with
    upper endoscopy is recommended in 3 to 5 years.
    

---

## Complications

---

- Reflux esophagitis (erosions/ulcers above GE jxn),
- strictures (caused by chronic inflamm)

### Barrett’s esoph. (BE):

*metaplastic columnar mucosa above GE jxn replaces squam epithel*.

- Screen if chronic (>5 y) and/or frequent GERD (≥1/wk) in ♂ w/ ≥2 risk factor for
Barrett’s/esophageal adeno: >50 y, white, hiatal hernia, central adiposity, smoking,
FHx of Barrett’s/esophageal adeno.
- In ♂, consider only if multiple RFs. 0.1–0.3%/y risk of esoph adenocarcinoma, ↑ if ↑ dysplasia .

**Management:** 

***PPI***. 

- **W/o dysplasia:** surveillance **EGD q3–5y.**
- **Low-grade dysplasia**: **EGD q12mo**; possible endoscopic eradication.
- **High-grade dysplasia**: **endoscopic eradication**; consider chemoprophylaxis w/ high-dose PPI & ASA
